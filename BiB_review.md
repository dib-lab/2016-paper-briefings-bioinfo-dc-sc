#### Body

* Need for training in computational biology 

	* Data suggests that a lack of training, not resources, is the barrier to computation in the hands of biologists (Kumar and Dudley, 2007). 
	* Difficulty integrating into curriculum at any level (Wilson 2016)
		* What level? High school, undergrad, graduate school? 
		* Who should teach? Biologists v computer scientists 
		* What department would host this? Biologists think computer scientists and computer scientists don't believe this information warrants a credit. 

* The Role of Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry in training computational biologists 
	* What are the missions of these organizations?
		* Software carpentry - to teach computational competence - not specific tools 
		* Data carpentry - teaching scientists basic skills for retrieving, viewing, managing, and manipulating data in an open and reproducible way
			* Both organizations are seeking make it easier for researchers to utilize tools for data analysis and to enhance reproducibility by introducing researchers to methods for carrying this out. 
			* Addressing the need to scale up bioinformatics training. 
	
	
	* Target populations 
		* (@ PTB - Not sure) - Researchers at all levels. The goal is cover topics required for efficient and reproducible data analysis based upon a community consensus. 
		
	
	
	* Strategies 
		* Collaborative lesson plan development
		* Volunteer teachers 
		
	
	* Evolution - Software carpentry (older) v Data Carpentry (new) 
		* Three iterations of software carpentry; started in 1998
			* Major obstacles to getting off the ground in iteration 1 and 2
				* Five day workshops would not scale well. 
				* A single instructor cannot reach enough people
				* Cobbling together funding from mutilple sources is difficult and distracting 
			* Some improvements in 3rd iteration 
				* Moving from 1 week to 2 day workshop increased participation 
				* Obtaining grant from sloan foundation decreased focus juggling funding from different organizations 
				* Moved toward higher level concepts 
					* Unix shell 
					* Programming in Pyton, R, or Matlab 
					* Version control 
					* More programming or databases 
				
			* Have outside contributions increased? 
			
		* Data carpentry - Origin 2014 (@PTB verify date of origin) 
	
	* Topics covered

	* Software carpentry - Sometimes; 20-40$. Charging decreases no*shows from ~1/3 to ~%5.

## Detailed outline

Proposed title 11: Training in data biology practice: Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry

Proposed title 2: Learning the practice of biological data analysis through Data and Software Carpentry.

Outline:

Intro
* Efficient and reproducible data analysis requires a lot of practical computational skills.
* These skills (equivalent of “wet lab” skills) are not usually taught in biology undergrad or grad (“should be CS”, no teachers, no expertise, fast moving field, etc.)
* Data analysis in biology (bioinformatics) is significantly about community of practice: latest tools, approaches, etc. (Salmon story?)
* Moreover, active researchers typically want to do a bottom up approach (show me what I need to know now, I will develop perspective around it).  Also, often deep in research and not interested in a whole course; intensive workshop instead.
* For all of these reasons, traditional curricula which focus on a theoretical introduction & grounding are a poor fit.
* Short, intensive workshops taught by active practitioners (potentially from remote institutions) may be one way to meet this need.
* data carpentry and software carpentry have emerged as global programs offering this.

Background

* outline of skills needs, coupled with software niches (R, Python, etc.)
* fast moving data sets, etc.
* community of practice: global tool ecosystem, blogs/social media, online
* these needs are common to computational science => software carpentry
* however, recognition that data == software is not immediately obvious to biologists.
* more recently, data carpentry has emerged using similar approach and similar network of trainers
* data carpentry is more focused on connecting between non-comp researchers and basic skills; SC is focused on sharpening and advancing people who already have skills
* why two days, etc.
