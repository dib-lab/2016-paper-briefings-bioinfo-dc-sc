## Outline:

Intro
* Efficient and reproducible data analysis requires a lot of practical computational skills.
* These skills (equivalent of “wet lab” skills) are not usually taught in biology undergrad or grad (“should be CS”, no teachers, no expertise, fast moving field, etc.)
* Data suggests that a lack of training, not resources, is the barrier to computation in the hands of biologists (Kumar and Dudley, 2007). 
	* Difficulty integrating into curriculum at any level (Wilson 2016)
		* What level? High school, undergrad, graduate school? 
		* Who should teach? Biologists v computer scientists 
		* What department would host this? Biologists think computer scientists and computer scientists don't believe this information warrant course credit. 
* Data analysis in biology (bioinformatics) is significantly about community of practice: latest tools, approaches, etc. (Salmon story?)
	* What is data science? 
		* Integrates knowledge from many fields including Biology, Computer science, chemistry, biology, pharmacology, agriculture,  etc. 
	* What are the current challenges in data science? 
	* How are data carpentry and software carpentry addressing these challenges? 
	* What are the skills required by a bioinformatician? 
	* The ability to integrate knowledge from different fields to address questions in Biology (Orozco et al. 2013). 
* Moreover, active researchers typically want to do a bottom up approach (show me what I need to know now, I will develop perspective around it).  Also, often deep in research and not interested in a whole course; intensive workshop instead.
* For all of these reasons, traditional curricula which focus on a theoretical introduction & grounding are a poor fit.
* Short, intensive workshops taught by active practitioners (potentially from remote institutions) may be one way to meet this need.
* data carpentry and software carpentry have emerged as global programs offering this.

Background

* outline of skills needs, coupled with software niches (R, Python, etc.)
* fast moving data sets, etc.
* community of practice: global tool ecosystem, blogs/social media, online
* these needs are common to computational science => software carpentry
* however, recognition that data == software is not immediately obvious to biologists.
* more recently, data carpentry has emerged using similar approach and similar network of trainers
* data carpentry is more focused on connecting between non-comp researchers and basic skills; SC is focused on sharpening and advancing people who already have skills
* why two days, etc.

A history of DC/SC
* Three iterations of software carpentry; started in 1998
	* Major obstacles to getting off the ground in iteration 1 and 2
		* Five day workshops would not scale well. 
		* A single instructor cannot reach enough people
		* Cobbling together funding from multiple sources is difficult and distracting 
* Some improvements in 3rd iteration 
	* Moving from 1 week to 2 day workshop increased participation 
	* Obtaining grant from sloan foundation decreased focus 
* Data carpentry - Origin 2014 (@PTB verify date of origin) 
	* Focused on introductory skills computational skills need for data analysis and management
	* Evolution - Software carpentry (older) v Data Carpentry (new) 
	*juggling funding from different organizations 
	* Moved toward *higher level* concepts (Versus???) 
		* Unix shell 
		* Programming in Pyton, R, or Matlab 
		* Version control 
		* More programming or databases 
* Have outside contributions increased? 

What DC and SC workshops look like and how they connect to skills
* Strategies 
	* Collaborative lesson plan development
	* Volunteer teachers
	* Topics covered... 
	* What are the missions of these organizations?
		* Software carpentry - to teach computational competence - not specific tools 
		* Data carpentry - teaching scientists basic skills for retrieving, viewing, managing, and manipulating data in an open and reproducible way
		* Both organizations are seeking make it easier for researchers to utilize tools for data analysis and to enhance reproducibility by introducing researchers to methods for carrying this out. 
		* Addressing the need to scale up bioinformatics training
* Target populations (Covered above but should be revisited here)
	* Software carpentry - Learners with "some" experience writing code. 
	* Data carpentry - Learners with little to no experience. 
* Cost 
	* Software carpentry - Sometimes; 20-40$. Charging decreases no-shows from ~1/3 to ~%5.
	* Data carpentry - Same as above 
*Institutions can request workshops 
	* DC and SC provide instructors; host covers travel costs and arranges room, technical resources, and refreshments. 

Assessment & impact

* Both software carpentry of Data Carpentry are global organizations?
	* Discuss countries reached
	* Impact in the US/Europe etc versus developing countries?
* How has either organization addressed underrepresented minorities in computational biology? 
	* DC - Workshop at SACNAS with Cyverse
	* SC - Workshops for women (12 or more since 2013) expand upon mention above
* Impact on reproducibility
Instructor training & instructor training report
* Three step training process
* Evidence that either organization is enhancing the quality of research products?
	* Data carpentry assessment results show that 95% of participants report increased appreciation for data management skills
	
Lesson development moving forward

Future of SC/DC
* Workshops that target specific groups
	* SC has offered workshops just for women - Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) 
	* Taught by women to a female audience -- Participants reported feeling more comfortable asking questions felt more comfortable admitting that they didn't know something

	* Workshops targeting other URM groups 

Opportunities - community development rare, open science, diversity, spread ug and postdoc, connect with industry for careers, instructor community

@PTB Questions to explore: 

* Does either organization have close affiliates/partners that help them accomplish their mission/goals? 
	* Cyverse? 
* How has either organization overcome technological barriers? 
 
* What are some tools/technologies that have been essential for carrying out the missions of these organizations? Any new technologies on the horizon?
